# Code-in-SML
This contains various codes written in sml during my course "Programming Languages"
Standard ML is a type-safe programming language that embodies many innovative ideas in programming language design. It is a statically typed language, with an extensible type system.
SML Language is quite unique in a sense as compared to other languages. Everything in here can be assumed to be a function which can be passed as an argument for another function. This thing is the key to writing codes in SML effectively.
